# frug-template

A production-shaped starter for Cloudflare Workers websites: Hono on the edge,
server-rendered JSX with HTMX, D1 + Drizzle, and a complete authentication and
RBAC system that is configured rather than written.

It is the platform layer extracted from a real application, so the parts that
are tedious to get right — passkeys, TOTP, account lockout, permission checks,
migrations, the build pipeline — are already done and already tested.

**No computer required.** Ask Claude for the changes you want, then deploy from
the Cloudflare dashboard — Cloudflare builds, migrates and ships on every push.
The full walkthrough is **[docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md)**.

Claude knows how to build on this template: the **`frugal` skill** in
`.claude/skills/frugal/` teaches it the frontend/backend split, the steps a new
feature needs, and the theme-token styling rules. It loads automatically when
you ask for a feature or a visual change.

## What you get

| Area        | What's included                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Auth**    | Password, PIN, TOTP and passkey/WebAuthn sign-in. Failed-attempt lockout, session limits, an `auth_logs` audit trail. Which methods a site offers is one env var.                     |
| **RBAC**    | Roles, per-role inherited permissions, per-user grants with expiry. `requireUser`, `requireRole`, `requirePermission` middleware and an `AccessControl` service for ownership checks. |
| **Data**    | Cloudflare D1 with Drizzle ORM. Zod validators derived from the same table definitions, so a schema change propagates to validation and types.                                        |
| **UI**      | Hono JSX server rendering, HTMX for partial updates, Tailwind v4, light/dark/system theming, toasts, dialogs. Lit Web Components only where client state is unavoidable.              |
| **Tooling** | Vite build for client and worker bundles, TypeScript project references, ESLint, Prettier, Vitest smoke tests, GitHub Actions CI.                                                     |
| **Deploy**  | Cloudflare's Git integration builds, migrates and deploys on every push. `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL` makes the first admin without a terminal. No CLI in the loop.                        |

## Starting a new site

**Use this repository as a GitHub template** — _Use this template → Create a new
repository_. Never configure this repo itself: real resource ids belong in the
repo made from it, or the next site inherits a live database.

Then, in the new repo:

### 0. Write a brief first

Claude builds a far better app when it knows the shape of the thing before the
first table exists, because the schema is the expensive part to change later.

**[docs/brief-prompt.md](docs/brief-prompt.md)** has a prompt you can paste into
any chat assistant — it interviews you and produces a brief in the shape this
template consumes. Paste the result into Claude Code and say "set the repo up
and start building". Prefer to write it yourself? Copy
**[docs/brief-template.md](docs/brief-template.md)**.

Claude then follows `.claude/skills/frugal/references/new-site.md`: it works out
which of D1, KV and R2 the app needs, asks you to create them, configures the
repo, models the domain in one migration, builds the features, and strips the
example.

Three things in the Cloudflare dashboard; Claude does the rest.
**[docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md)** is the step-by-step version.

### 1. Create the resources (dashboard)

**Storage & Databases → D1 → Create**, and **→ KV → Create Instance**. Copy the
**Database ID** (a UUID) and the **Namespace ID** (32 hex). Add an R2 bucket
only if the site stores files.

| Binding | Needed when                                                  |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **D1**  | Always — auth and roles live here                            |
| **KV**  | Passkey sign-in is enabled (it holds the WebAuthn challenge) |
| **R2**  | Users upload or download files                               |

A binding declared but not provisioned fails the deploy, so tell Claude which
ones you want and it removes the rest.

These ids are not secrets — they are useless without an API token for your
account, which is why they live in version control.

### 2. Tell Claude (chat)

Paste the ids in and say what the site is called. Claude runs:

```bash
npm run configure -- \
  --name my-site --app-name "My Site" \
  --domain my-site.example.com \
  --d1-name my-site-db --d1-id <uuid> --kv-id <32-hex> \
  --admin-email me@example.com
```

which fills every placeholder in `wrangler.jsonc`, validates the ids, and
reports anything still unset. Then it commits and pushes.

### 3. Set the secret + connect the repo (dashboard)

**Settings → Variables and Secrets → Add**, type **Secret**, name
`JWT_SECRET`. Then **Settings → Builds → Connect**, pick the repo, and set:

| Field          | Value            |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| Build command  | `npm run build`  |
| Deploy command | `npm run deploy` |

`npm run deploy` runs `wrangler d1 migrations apply DB --remote && wrangler
deploy`, so the schema is migrated immediately before the new code goes live.

### 4. Become the admin

Register on the live site with the email you passed as `--admin-email`. That
account is granted `admin` on sign-up, because `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL` is set.

It only fires while **no admin exists**, so it disarms itself the moment it
works — no terminal, and no standing back door.

### 5. Make it yours

- Replace `worker/views/pages/Home.tsx` with a real landing page.
- Replace `public/favicon.svg`.
- Edit `menuConfig` in `worker/views/components/NavBar.tsx` to add nav links.
- Delete the Notes example (below) once you've copied its shape.

### Roles, permissions and auth methods

All of it is configuration in `wrangler.jsonc`:

```jsonc
"AUTH_METHODS": "password,passkey,totp",  // passkey, password, pin, totp, email, sms
"ROLES_AVAILABLE": "user,admin",
"ROLES_DEFAULT": "user",                  // assigned at registration
"ROLES_RESTRICTED": "admin",              // cannot be self-assigned via the API
"PERMISSIONS_AVAILABLE": "posts.read,posts.create,posts.update.any",
"ROLES_INHERENT": "user:posts.read,posts.create;admin:*"
```

`resource.action` grants the action **on rows you own**; `resource.action.any`
grants it on anyone's; `*` expands to everything in `PERMISSIONS_AVAILABLE`.
Mirror the resource names in the `Resource` type in
`worker/services/access.service.ts`.

Disabled auth methods vanish from the UI and their API routes return 404 — you
never delete code to turn one off.

---

## Adding a feature

The `notes` feature is a complete worked example — schema, validation,
guarded routes, ownership checks, HTMX fragments and soft deletes — in four
small files. To build your own, copy its shape:

1. **Schema** — `worker/schema/note.schema.ts`. Define the Drizzle table,
   spread `ownershipColumns` for `userId` + timestamps, and derive Zod
   schemas with `drizzle-zod`.
2. **Migration** — `npm run gen`. Cloudflare applies it on the next deploy.
3. **Views** — `worker/views/notes/NoteComponents.tsx`. Pure functions of
   props; no data access. Give every HTMX-swappable fragment a stable `id`.
4. **Routes** — `worker/routes/notes.tsx`. Guard with `requireUser`, validate
   with `zValidator`, authorize with `AccessControl`, respond with
   `htmxResponse`.
5. **Mount** — add the router in `worker/app.tsx` and a nav link in `NavBar.tsx`.
6. **Permissions** — add the strings to `PERMISSIONS_AVAILABLE` and the
   resource to the `Resource` type.

Then delete the notes files: `worker/schema/note.schema.ts`,
`worker/routes/notes.tsx`, `worker/views/notes/`, and its references in
`worker/app.tsx`, `worker/routes/dev.tsx` and `NavBar.tsx`.

## Commands

You do not need any of these — Cloudflare runs the build and deploy. They are
here for local work, and for Claude to run on your behalf.

| Command                                  | Does                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run configure -- --help`            | Fill in `wrangler.jsonc` for a new site                           |
| `npm run dev`                            | Vite dev server with hot reload at `:3000`                        |
| `npm run build`                          | Generate types, typecheck, build client + server bundles          |
| `npm run deploy`                         | Migrate, then deploy — **this is the dashboard's Deploy command** |
| `npm run preview`                        | Build, then run the real worker under Wrangler                    |
| `npm run typecheck`                      | `tsc -b`                                                          |
| `npm run lint`                           | ESLint                                                            |
| `npm run format:write`                   | Prettier                                                          |
| `npm run test`                           | Vitest                                                            |
| `npm run gen`                            | Regenerate Drizzle migrations and Wrangler types                  |
| `npm run migrate:local` / `:remote`      | Apply D1 migrations (targets the `DB` binding)                    |
| `npm run create-admin:local` / `:remote` | Create or promote an admin directly                               |

Run `npm run gen` after **any** change to `worker/schema/` or `wrangler.jsonc` —
it regenerates both the SQL migration and `worker-configuration.d.ts`.
`npm run build` regenerates the types on its own, which is why Cloudflare's
build works without the generated file being committed.

Bun works for all of these too; `package-lock.json` is committed because npm is
what Cloudflare's build image detects most reliably.

Path aliases: `@server/*` → `worker/*`, `@views/*` → `worker/views/*`,
`@components/*` → `worker/components/*`.

## Conventions

- **Money is integer cents.** Convert at the edges with `dollarsToCents` and
  `formatCents`; never store or arithmetic on floats.
- **Soft delete.** Set `deletedAt` and filter with `isNull(...)` rather than
  deleting rows, so audit history survives.
- **Server-render first.** Reach for HTMX fragments before a Web Component.
  Components in `worker/components/` are for state the server genuinely cannot
  hold — WebAuthn ceremonies, theme preference, modals.
- **Never return a raw `users` row.** `Auth.toSafeUser()` strips
  `passwordHash`, `pin` and `totpSecret` and hydrates roles and permissions.
  Every path out of the auth service goes through it.
- **`/dev` is admin-gated** because it dumps every table. Delete the router
  for sites handling sensitive data.

## Security checklist before going live

- [ ] `JWT_SECRET` set as a **Secret** in the dashboard — not a Variable, not a
      Build variable, never in `wrangler.jsonc`
- [ ] `RP_ID` and `ORIGIN` match the deployed hostname exactly
- [ ] `JWT_EXPIRY` is in **seconds** (`86400` = 24h), not milliseconds
- [ ] `ALLOWED_EMAILS` set if registration should be invite-only
- [ ] `ROLES_RESTRICTED` includes every privileged role
- [ ] Admin account created via the `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL` flow, and the
      variable cleared afterwards
- [ ] `/dev` router deleted or confirmed admin-only
- [ ] `grep -in "change.me\|0000000" wrangler.jsonc` returns only comment lines
- [ ] `npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run test` all green
