/**
 * A real SQLite database, built from the real migrations, for tests that
 * depend on what the database actually does.
 *
 * `createFakeDb` is a shape stub: it ignores `where` clauses entirely, so
 * every query against it returns the same rows. That is fine for "does this
 * page render", and worthless for anything about authentication, where the
 * whole question is whether a `where` matched the right row — a login test
 * against the fake db passes just as happily when the lookup is wrong.
 *
 * This runs `drizzle/*.sql` against an in-memory database through
 * `node:sqlite`, so the schema under test is the schema that ships. No new
 * dependency: drizzle's sqlite-proxy driver takes any callback that can run
 * SQL, and Node has had SQLite built in since 22.
