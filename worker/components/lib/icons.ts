/**
 * The icon set this app ships.
 *
 * Lucide has ~1600 icons and its UMD bundle is 377KB. Importing them
 * individually lets the bundler drop the rest, so the client pays for the
 * handful actually used instead of the whole library.
 *
 * The cost of that trade is this file: an icon used in markup but missing here
 * renders as nothing. `renderIcons()` warns about exactly that, and
 * `tests/icons.test.ts` fails the build for any `data-lucide="…"` literal in
 * the source that is not registered — so the usual case is caught before it
 * ships, and the dynamic case is caught in the console.
 *
 * ADDING AN ICON: find it at https://lucide.dev, import it below in
 * PascalCase, and add it to `ICONS`. Nothing else to touch.
